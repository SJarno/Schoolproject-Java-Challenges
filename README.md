# Schoolproject - Java challenges, eight parts

# About
Actually seven projects, as the supplier didn't cough up part five at the moment. 

So these are simple challenge projects related to school I'm studying at the moment. 

Mostly for flexing out my Java-skills, and trying some new stuff.
I'll be making slightly more complicated versions out of some of these, but as of now, this will do.

Projects are:
- Challenge I [testi](#challenge-i---rock-paper-scissors)
- Challenge II
- Challenge III
- Challenge IV
- Challenge V
- Challenge VI
- Challenge VII
- Challenge VIII
