# Schoolproject - Java challenges, eight parts

# About
Actually seven projects, as the supplier didn't cough up part five at the moment. 

So these are simple challenge projects related to school I'm studying at the moment. 

Mostly for flexing out my Java-skills, and trying some new stuff.
I'll be making slightly more complicated versions out of some of these, but as of now, this will do.

## General

Build with Java 11 and JUnit 5.

Projects are:
- [Challenge I](Haaste1/challengeone/README.md)
- [Challenge II](#challenge-ii---calories-vs-joules)
- [Challenge III](#challenge-iii---meatpie-proble)
- [Challenge IV](#challenge-iv---grades)
- [Challenge V](#challenge-v---empty)
- [Challenge VI](#challenge-vi---pin-and-puk-codes)
- [Challenge VII](#challenge-vii---counternumber)
- [Challenge VIII](#challenge-viii---numbers-to-string)

### Assignment
#### Stage 1.
Make a method that transforms numbers in string to string representations. The modifidable is passed as a parameter from another class, and the method returns the result back to the calling class.

Example:
Original text: "Mister Huu's address is tattisuonkatu 4 A 123".

Modified text/result: "Mister Huu's addres is tattisuonkatu neljä A satakaksikymmentäkolme".

#### Stage 2.
Refactor the method so that the program reads the original text from a textfile.
#### Stage 3 (optional)
Refactor the program so that it saves the modified thext to a textfile.
