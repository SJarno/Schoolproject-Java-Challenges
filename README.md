# Schoolproject - Java challenges, eight parts

# About
Actually seven projects, as the supplier didn't cough up part five at the moment. 

So these are simple challenge projects related to school I'm studying at the moment. 

Mostly for flexing out my Java-skills, and trying some new stuff.
I'll be making slightly more complicated versions out of some of these, but as of now, this will do.

## General

Build with Java 11 and JUnit 5.

Projects are:
- [Challenge I](#challenge-i---rock-paper-scissors)
- [Challenge II](#challenge-ii---calories-vs-joules)
- [Challenge III](#challenge-iii---meatpie-proble)
- [Challenge IV](#challenge-iv---grades)
- [Challenge V](#challenge-v---empty)
- [Challenge VI](#challenge-vi---pin-and-puk-codes)
- [Challenge VII](#challenge-vii---counternumber)
- [Challenge VIII](#challenge-viii---numbers-to-string)


## Challenge I - Rock, Paper, Scissors

### About

Rock, Paper and Scissors, a well known game for two or more participants. 

### Assignment
Write a program where the player plays against a computer.

The winner is defined as follows:
- Rock defeats scissors (scissors can be broken with a rock, and scissors cant cut rock)
- Paper defeats rock (paper can cover a rock)
- Scissors defeats paper (scissors can cut paper)

If both players have the same selection, the round is a tie, and wil be replayed.

The program runs as follows:
1. The computer starts asking the following: 1 = Rock, 2 = Paper, 3 = Scissors?
2. The player chooses on of the above options, and the compuer counters with its own.
3. The program declares the winner of the round

### Features
Build as a maven project. Requires Java 11 and JUnit 5.x.

## Challenge VIII - Numbers to String
### About
### Assignment
#### Stage 1.
Make a method that transforms numbers in string to string representations. The modifidable is passed as a parameter from another class, and the method returns the result back to the calling class.
Example:
Original text: "Mister Huu's address is tattisuonkatu 4 A 123".
Modified text/result: "Mister Huu's addres is tattisuonkatu neljä A satakaksikymmentäkolme".
#### Stage 2.
Refactor the method so that the program reads the original text from a textfile.
#### Stage 3 (optional)
Refactor the program so that it saves the modified thext to a textfile.
